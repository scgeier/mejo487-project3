                <h2>Where are you from, exactly?</h2>
                <p>In 1986 the University of North Carolina Board of Governors created policy 700.1.3 which limited
                    out-of-state enrollment at UNC system schools to 18% of the incoming first-year class.
                    Coincidentally, just one year before, Richard Moll first coined the term "Public Ivies", a
                    group of top-tier public universities to which the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
                    belongs. The capped out-of-state enrollment at UNC is much lower than at peer universities. The
                    bar graph below shows the undergraduate student population of three top public universities
                    based on students’ geographical origin.</p>

                    do at UNC-Chapel Hill. Without the restriction of strict quotas, the University of Virginia’s
                    undergraduate student body is roughly 30% out-of-state. These students paid $45,276 each in
                    tuition in fees in the 2016-2017 school year - a pretty penny for a top-tier public education
                    far from home.</p>

                <h2>Tuition revenue paints a nuanced portrait of admission trends at the Public Ivies</h2>
                <p>It comes as no surprise that out-of-state students at public universities pay more in tuition
                    and fees than their in-state peers. How this well-known disparity impacts total revenue,
                    however, paints a more nuanced picture of university finances in 2017. At UNC-Chapel Hill,
                    out-of-state students make up 18-19% of the student body. Their contributions to total tuition
                    revenue, however, was 46%. Less than one-fifth of the UNC-Chapel Hill student body generates
                    nearly half of the tuition revenue. This proportion has fluctuated between 46% and 50% since
                    2000.</p>
                <p>The charts below show the evolution of out-of-state enrollment at UNC-Chapel Hill, U-Va. and
                    UC-Berkeley from 2005 to 2017.</p>

                <p>In 2005, only 9% of the UC-Berkeley undergraduate student body was from out of state. By 2016,
                    that proportion had reached 24%. The enrollment shift allowed UC-Berkeley to meet its peers in
                    generating roughly half of all tuition revenue from out-of-state students. The University of
                    Virginia has consistently generated more of its tuition from out-of-state students than
                    UNC-Chapel Hill and UC-Berkeley, with 55% of its $673 million in tuition revenue coming from
                    outside Virginia’s borders in 2016.</p>

                        target="_blank">A 2016 article</a> in The Daily Tar Heel quoted a representative of the
                    Campaign for College Opportunity as saying, “The reason why they’re doing it is because of
                    inconsistent state funding. They’re going to try to enroll more out-of-state students to pay
                    for in-state students.” This trend, the article explains, came in the wake of the 2008
                    recession.</p>
                <p>The trend of enrolling out-of-state students helps generate much-needed revenue as state
                    legislatures across the country have reduced their education spending. Many state residents
                    argue that this tactic defies the mission behind public universities, which are, in theory,
                    designed to be of and for the people of their state.</p>

                <h2>Not your parents' tuition</h2>
                <p>Since 1947, tuition at UNC-Chapel Hill has risen exponentially. An out-of-state student paid
                    just $244 for the 1947-1955 school year. In 2016-2017 that same student would be required to
                    pay $33,916 for the same education. Even adjusting for inflation, the 2017 tuition is 13 times
                    more than its 1947 counterpart.</p>
                <p>The tool below allows you to calculate how much you, your parents and your grandparents would
                    have paid to attend UNC-Chapel Hill. The tool assumes a generational gap of 25 years and does
                    not account for inflation. A tool to quickly adjust for inflation as you explore can be found
